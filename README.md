SGDBoop-SteamVR is a tool, based on SGDBoop, that automatically applies assets from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) directly to your Steam library, removing the need to download and set them manually, but converted to Python, and also supports your SteamVR Home Library.

### Once installed, head over to https://www.steamgriddb.com/boop to enable the "**BOOP**" buttons!
